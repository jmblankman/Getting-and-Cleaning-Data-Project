This repository is my submission for John Hopkin's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

The dataset used was "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" taken from UCI's Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes 
recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with 
embedded inertial sensors.
